I'm about to set up a Heroku App for this server. 
To get it to run locally, you'll need to do 3 things:
1. Add the Google Service Account Private Key file to your .env with the name GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
2. Run npm install
3. Run pip install -r requirements.txt

Then you can npm start and test it out.
